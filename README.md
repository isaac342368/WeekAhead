# WeekAhead

WeekAhead is an innovative web application that I designed and developed to help users plan their outdoor activities effectively based on real-time weather forecasts. Through a user-friendly interface created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, users can input their desired activity details and receive personalized weather advisories for the next seven days.
After uses choses dates and fills out time and activity name, the app cross checks these dates/times with weather data and notifies the user if there are any bad weather conditions that may interfere with their plans
