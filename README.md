# WeekAhead

WeekAhead is an innovative web application that I designed and developed to help users plan their outdoor activities effectively based on real-time weather forecasts. Through a user-friendly interface created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, users can input their desired activity details and receive personalized weather advisories for the next seven days.
After uses choses dates and fills out time and activity name, the app cross checks these dates/times with weather data and notifies the user if there are any bad weather conditions that may interfere with their plans

To overcome API restrictions, I leveraged Node.js and Express.js to create a backend server, resolving CORS issues and ensuring a smooth user experience. Deploying the frontend on GitHub Pages further demonstrated my skills in project deployment and sharing web applications with a wider audience.

IMPORTANT:_
As the API subscription can be expensive and I might not always have it active, I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause during your visit. Thank you for understanding.
FUTURE:
Adding traffic information to proivde user with suggestions  on traffic info.
